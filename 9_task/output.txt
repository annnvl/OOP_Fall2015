Plot
B*ckground
Throughout the six previous novels in the series, the titul*r ch*r*cter ***** Potter h*s struggled with the difficulties of *dolescence *long with being * f*mous ******. When ***** w*s * b*by, Lord Voldemort, * powerful evil ******, murdered *****'s p*rents but v*nished *fter *ttempting to kill *****. ***** immedi*tely bec*me f*mous, *nd w*s pl*ced in the c*re of his Muggle (non-m*gic*l) rel*tives Aunt Petuni* *nd Uncle Vernon.

In Philosopher's Stone, ***** re-enters the ******ing world *t *ge 11 *nd enrols in Hogw*rts School of Witchcr*ft *nd Wiz*rdry. He m*kes friends with Ron We*sley *nd Hermione Gr*nger. ***** *lso meets the school's he*dm*ster, Albus Dumbledore, *nd Professor Severus Sn*pe, who dislikes him. ***** fights Voldemort sever*l times while *t school, *s the ****** tries to reg*in * physic*l form. In Goblet of Fire, ***** is entered in * d*ngerous m*gic*l competition c*lled the Tri****** Tourn*ment. At the conclusion of the Tourn*ment, ***** witnesses the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. During Order of the Phoenix, ***** *nd sever*l of his friends f*ce off *g*inst Voldemort's De*th E*ters, * group of D*rk witches *nd ******s, *nd n*rrowly defe*t them. In H*lf-Blood Prince, ***** le*rns th*t Voldemort h*s cre*ted six "horcruxes" to become immort*l. A Horcrux is * fr*gment of * person's soul pl*ced within *n object so th*t when the body dies, * p*rt of the soul rem*ins *nd the person c*n be regener*ted or resurrected.[4] However, the destruction of the cre*tor's body le*ves the ****** or witch in * st*te of h*lf-life, without corpore*l form.[5] Two horcruxes h*ve *lre*dy been destroyed, one by ***** in the events of Ch*mber of Secrets *nd one by Dumbledore shortly before the events of H*lf-Blood Prince. When returning from * mission to discover * horcrux, Dumbledore is murdered by Sn*pe, * former De*th E*ter whom ***** suspected of secretly rem*ining loy*l to Voldemort. At the conclusion of the book, ***** decides to le*ve school, find *nd destroy the rem*ining four Horcruxes, *nd defe*t the evil ****** Voldemort, once *nd for *ll.

Summ*ry
Following Dumbledore's de*th, Voldemort continues to g*in support *nd incre*se his power. ***** is *bout to turn seventeen, *t which point the protection he h*s *t his *unt *nd uncle's house will be broken. Before th*t c*n h*ppen, M*d-Eye Moody *nd other members of the Order of the Phoenix move ***** to the Burrow, using Polyjuice Potion to imperson*te him so *s to confuse *ny De*th E*ters th*t m*y *tt*ck. They *re indeed *tt*cked immedi*tely *fter le*ving Privet Drive; M*d-Eye is killed, *nd George We*sley wounded (his e*r is cut off), but the rest *rrive s*fely *t the Burrow.

Ron *nd Hermione decide to *ccomp*ny *****, inste*d of returning to Hogw*rts School for their seventh ye*r, to finish the quest Dumbledore st*rted: to hunt *nd destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes, four of which rem*in. They h*ve little knowledge *bout the rem*ining Horcruxes except th*t one is * locket once owned by Hogw*rts' co-founder S*l*z*r Slytherin, one is possibly * cup once owned by co-founder Helg* Hufflepuff, * third m*y be connected with co-founder Rowen* R*vencl*w, *nd the fourth m*y be N*gini, Voldemort's sn*ke f*mili*r. The where*bouts of the founders' objects is unknown, *nd N*gini is presumed to be with Voldemort.

Before le*ving, they *ttend Ron's brother Bill's wedding to Fleur Del*cour, with ***** disguised by Polyjuice Potion, but the Ministry of M*gic is t*ken over by De*th E*ters *nd the wedding is *tt*cked, *nd *****, Ron, *nd Hermione b*rely esc*pe with their lives.

The three flee to 12 Grimm*uld Pl*ce in London, which is Sirius Bl*ck's f*mily's house, where they le*rn from the house-elf Kre*cher th*t Slytherin's locket, once stolen by Sirius's brother Regulus, is now in the possession of Dolores Umbridge. They infiltr*te the Ministry of M*gic *nd ste*l b*ck the locket, but h*ve nothing with which to destroy it, *nd under the object's evil influence *nd the str*in of const*ntly being on the run, Ron le*ves the others.

As ***** *nd Hermione continue the quest, they le*rn more *bout Dumbledore's p*st, including the ins*nity *nd de*th of Dumbledore's younger sister *nd his connection to the d*rk ****** Grindelw*ld. ***** *nd Hermione ultim*tely tr*vel to Godric's Hollow, *****'s birthpl*ce *nd the pl*ce where his p*rents died. They meet the elderly m*gic*l histori*n B*thild* B*gshot, who turns out to be N*gini in disguise *nd *tt*cks them.

They esc*pe into the Forest of De*n, where * mysterious silver doe th*t *ppe*rs to be * P*tronus le*ds ***** to the Sword of Hogw*rts co-founder Godric Gryffindor, one of the few objects *ble to destroy Horcruxes, lying *t the bottom of *n icy l*ke. When ***** *ttempts to recover the sword from the pool, the Horcrux *ttempts to kill him. Ron re*ppe*rs, s*ving ***** *nd then using the sword to destroy the locket.

Resuming their se*rch, the trio repe*tedly encounter * str*nge symbol th*t *n eccentric ****** n*med Xenophilius Lovegood tells them represents the mythic*l De*thly *******. The ******* *re three s*cred objects: the Elder W*nd, *n unbe*t*ble w*nd; the Resurrection Stone, with the power to summon the de*d to the living world; *nd *n inf*llible Invisibility Clo*k. ***** le*rns th*t Voldemort is seeking the Elder W*nd, recognises the Resurrection Stone from the second Horcrux, which Dumbledore destroyed, *nd re*lises th*t his own Invisibility Clo*k is the one mentioned in the story, but he is un*w*re of the *******' true signific*nce.

The trio *re c*ptured *nd t*ken to M*lfoy M*nor, where Bell*trix Lestr*nge tortures Hermione. ***** *nd Ron *re thrown in the cell*r, where they find Lun* Lovegood, Olliv*nder, De*n Thom*s, *nd Griphook. Before Voldemort c*n *rrive, Dobby *ppe*rs *nd rescues them, *nd the entire group esc*pes to Shell Cott*ge, Bill *nd Fleur's house, but *t the cost of Dobby's life.

***** now re*lises th*t the ******* m*y h*ve the power to defe*t De*th *nd knows th*t Voldemort robbed Dumbledore's tomb to procure the Elder W*nd, but he decides to focus on finding the Horcruxes inste*d of the *******. They le*rn from Griphook th*t Helg* Hufflepuff's cup – * Horcrux – is hidden in Bell*trix's v*ult *t Gringotts. With Griphook's help, they bre*k into the v*ult, retrieve the cup, *nd esc*pe on * dr*gon, but Griphook t*kes the sword *nd esc*pes on his own. From his connection to Voldemort's thoughts, ***** le*rns th*t *nother Horcrux is hidden in Hogw*rts, which is now under the control of Severus Sn*pe.

*****, Ron, *nd Hermione enter the school through Hogsme*de *nd, with the help of the te*chers, confront Sn*pe, who flees. They then destroy the cup with * b*silisk f*ng th*t Ron *nd Hermione h*ve retrieved from the Ch*mber of Secrets, *nd *ttempt to loc*te the next horcrux, Rowen* R*vencl*w's di*dem. Me*nwhile, Voldemort *nd his *rmy of De*th E*ters *nd other *llies besiege the c*stle. M*ny students, te*chers, members of the Order of the Phoenix, *nd v*rious m*gic*l cre*tures fend off the *tt*ckers while *****, Ron, *nd Hermione m*ke their w*y to the Room of Requirement, where the di*dem is hidden. However, they *re c*ught by Dr*co M*lfoy, Vincent Cr*bbe, *nd Gregory Goyle. During the ensuing fight, Cr*bbe c*sts * Fiendfyre curse in *n *ttempt to kill *****, Ron, *nd Hermione, but is un*ble to control it *nd destroys the di*dem *nd himself, while *****, Ron, *nd Hermione rescue M*lfoy *nd Goyle on * p*ir of old brooms. Me*nwhile, sever*l m*jor ch*r*cters *re killed in the b*ttle with Voldemort's forces, including Remus Lupin, Nymph*dor* Tonks, *nd Fred We*sley.

Voldemort is un*ble to use the Elder W*nd's full potenti*l, *nd believing th*t Severus Sn*pe bec*me its m*ster when he killed Dumbledore, kills Sn*pe in order to become its m*ster himself. As Sn*pe dies, he gives ***** some of his memories, which ***** then views using the Pensieve in the He*dm*ster's office, *nd discovers Sn*pe's true motiv*tions: Sn*pe's loy*lty to Dumbledore never w*vered, driven by his love for *****'s mother, whom Voldemort killed, *nd Dumbledore's de*th *t Sn*pe's h*nd w*s by Dumbledore's own instructions, *s he w*s *lre*dy dying. ***** *lso le*rns th*t Voldemort in*dvertently m*de ***** into * seventh Horcrux when he *tt*cked him *s * b*by, *nd th*t in order for Voldemort to be destroyed, ***** must die by Voldemort's h*nd, * f*ct th*t Dumbledore h*s *lw*ys known.

***** decides to confront Voldemort, who is w*iting for him in the Forbidden Forest, by himself. He sne*ks out of the c*stle, *nd *fter using the Resurrection Stone to bring b*ck his dece*sed loved ones for * short while, ***** surrenders himself. Voldemort c*sts the Killing Curse *t him, *pp*rently killing him, *nd ***** *w*kens in wh*t *ppe*rs to be King's Cross St*tion, * pl*ce th*t serves *s * link between the muggle *nd ******ing worlds, *s ***** is in * pl*ce between life *nd de*th. While in this st*te, Dumbledore's spirit expl*ins to ***** th*t when Voldemort used *****'s blood to reg*in his full strength, it protected ***** from Voldemort killing him; however, the Horcrux inside ***** h*s now been destroyed, *nd ***** c*n return to his body despite being hit by the Killing Curse. Dumbledore *lso expl*ins th*t ***** bec*me the true m*ster of the De*thly ******* by f*cing De*th, not by seeking to *void it or conquer it.

***** returns to his body, feigning de*th, *nd Voldemort m*rches victoriously into the c*stle with his body. However, following *****'s prior instructions, Neville Longbottom kills N*gini, the l*st Horcrux, with the Sword of Gryffindor. ***** then reve*ls th*t he is still *live, *nd the b*ttle resumes, with Bell*trix Lestr*nge being killed by Molly We*sley.

***** *nd Voldemort eng*ge in * fin*l clim*ctic duel. ***** reve*ls th*t bec*use he willingly s*crificed himself to de*th by Voldemort's h*nd, his *ct of love would protect the Wiz*rding community from Voldemort in the s*me w*y the s*crifice *****'s mother m*de protected *****. ***** *lso reve*ls th*t Sn*pe w*s not loy*l to Voldemort, did not murder Dumbledore, *nd w*s never the m*ster of the Elder W*nd. Inste*d, Dr*co w*s the m*ster of the Elder W*nd *fter dis*rming Dumbledore, but, bec*use ***** h*d dis*rmed Dr*co *t M*lfoy M*nor, ***** is the true m*ster of the Elder W*nd. ***** cl*ims th*t the w*nd will refuse to kill the one to whom it owes *llegi*nce, further protecting him. During the duel, ***** refuses to use the killing curse *nd even encour*ges Voldemort to feel remorse, one known w*y to restore Voldemort's sh*ttered soul. Voldemort dies when his own killing curse b*ckfires *g*inst *****'s dis*rming curse, killing himself; the De*th E*ters *re fin*lly defe*ted.

The ******ing world is *ble to live in pe*ce once more.

Epilogue
The novel, the l*st in the series, closes with * brief epilogue set 19 ye*rs l*ter, in which ***** *nd Ginny We*sley *re * couple with three children: J*mes Sirius, Albus Severus, *nd Lily Lun*. Ron *nd Hermione *lso h*ve two children, Rose *nd Hugo. The f*milies meet *t King's Cross st*tion, where * nervous Albus is dep*rting for his first ye*r *t Hogw*rts. *****'s godson, Teddy Lupin, is found kissing Bill *nd Fleur We*sley's d*ughter Victoire in * tr*in c*rri*ge. ***** sees Dr*co M*lfoy *nd his wife with their son, Scorpius. Neville Longbottom is now * Hogw*rts professor *nd rem*ins friends with the two f*milies. ***** comforts Albus, who is worried he will be sorted into Slytherin, *nd tells his son th*t one of his two n*mes*kes, Severus Sn*pe, w*s * Slytherin *nd the br*vest m*n he h*d ever met. He ***s th*t the Sorting H*t t*kes one's choice into *ccount, *s it did for *****. The book ends with these fin*l words: "The sc*r h*d not p*ined ***** for nineteen ye*rs. All w*s well."

B*ckground

***** Potter *nd the Philosopher's Stone w*s published by Bloomsbury, the publisher of *ll ***** Potter books in the United Kingdom, on 30 June 1997.[6] It w*s rele*sed in the United St*tes on 1 September 1998 by Schol*stic—the Americ*n publisher of the books—*s ***** Potter *nd the Sorcerer's Stone,[7] *fter Rowling h*d received US$105,000 for the Americ*n rights—*n unprecedented *mount for * children's book by * then-unknown *uthor.[8]

The second book, ***** Potter *nd the Ch*mber of Secrets w*s origin*lly published in the UK on 2 July 1998, *nd in the US on 2 June 1999. ***** Potter *nd the Prisoner of Azk*b*n w*s then published * ye*r l*ter in the UK on 8 July 1999, *nd in the US on 8 September 1999.[9] ***** Potter *nd the Goblet of Fire w*s published on 8 July 2000 *t the s*me time by Bloomsbury *nd Schol*stic.[10] ***** Potter *nd the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series *t 766 p*ges in the UK version *nd 870 p*ges in the US version.[11] It w*s published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.[12] ***** Potter *nd the H*lf-Blood Prince w*s published on 16 July 2005, *nd it sold 9 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide rele*se.[13][14]

Choice of title
Shortly before rele*sing the title, J. K. Rowling *nnounced th*t she h*d considered three titles for the book.[15][16] The fin*l title, ***** Potter *nd the De*thly *******, n*med *fter the mythic*l De*thly ******* in the novel, w*s rele*sed to the public on 21 December 2006, vi* * speci*l Christm*s-themed h*ngm*n puzzle on Rowling's website, confirmed shortly *fterw*rds by the book's publishers.[17] When *sked during * live ch*t *bout the other titles she h*d been considering, Rowling mentioned ***** Potter *nd the Elder W*nd *nd ***** Potter *nd the Peverell Quest.[15]

Rowling on finishing the book

Rowling completed the fin*l ch*pters of De*thly ******* in Room 652 of the B*lmor*l Hotel.
Rowling completed the book while st*ying *t the B*lmor*l Hotel in Edinburgh in J*nu*ry 2007, *nd left * signed st*tement on * m*rble bust of Hermes in her room which re*d: "J. K. Rowling finished writing ***** Potter *nd the De*thly ******* in this room (652) on 11 J*nu*ry 2007".[18] In * st*tement on her website, she s*id, "I've never felt such * mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dre*med I could feel simult*neously he*rtbroken *nd euphoric." She comp*red her mixed feelings to those expressed by Ch*rles Dickens in the pref*ce of the 1850 edition of D*vid Copperfield, "* two-ye*rs' im*gin*tive t*sk". "To which," she ***ed, "I c*n only sigh, try seventeen ye*rs, Ch*rles". She ended her mess*ge by s*ying "De*thly ******* is my f*vourite, *nd th*t is the most wonderful w*y to finish the series".[19]

When *sked before public*tion *bout the forthcoming book, Rowling st*ted th*t she could not ch*nge the ending even if she w*nted. "These books h*ve been plotted for such * long time, *nd for six books now, th*t they're *ll le*ding * cert*in direction. So, I re*lly c*n't".[20] She *lso commented th*t the fin*l volume rel*ted closely to the previous book in the series, ***** Potter *nd the H*lf-Blood Prince, "*lmost *s though they *re two-h*lves of the s*me novel".[21] She h*s s*id th*t the l*st ch*pter of the book w*s written "in something like 1990", *s p*rt of her e*rliest work on the series.[22] Rowling *lso reve*led she origin*lly wrote the l*st words to be "something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning sc*r'". Rowling ch*nged this bec*use she did not w*nt people to think Voldemort would rise *g*in *nd to s*y th*t *****'s mission w*s over.[23][24]

M*jor themes
A blonde wom*n with blue eyes h*s * red *nd white robe on over her dress is holding *n honor*ry degree with her left h*nd.
J. K. Rowling h*s s*id th*t the m*in theme of the series is ***** de*ling with de*th.
De*th
In * 2006 interview, J. K. Rowling s*id th*t the m*in theme of the series is ***** de*ling with de*th,[25] which w*s influenced by her mother's de*th in 1990, from multiple sclerosis.[23][25][26][27] Lev Grossm*n of Time st*ted th*t the m*in theme of the series w*s the overwhelming import*nce of continuing to love in the f*ce of de*th.[28]

Living in * corrupted society
Ac*demics *nd journ*lists h*ve developed m*ny other interpret*tions of themes in the books, some more complex th*n others, *nd some including politic*l subtexts. Themes such *s norm*lity, oppression, surviv*l, *nd overcoming imposing odds h*ve *ll been considered *s prev*lent throughout the series.[29] Simil*rly, the theme of m*king one's w*y through *dolescence *nd "going over one's most h*rrowing orde*ls—*nd thus coming to terms with them" h*s *lso been considered.[30] Rowling h*s st*ted th*t the books comprise "* prolonged *rgument for toler*nce, * prolonged ple* for *n end to bigotry" *nd th*t *lso p*ss on * mess*ge to "question *uthority *nd ... not *ssume th*t the est*blishment or the press tells you *ll of the truth".[31]

Some politic*l comment*tors h*ve seen J. K. Rowling's portr*y*l of the bure*ucr*tised Ministry of M*gic *nd the oppressive me*sures t*ken by the Ministry in the l*ter books (like m*king *ttend*nce *t Hogw*rts School compulsory *nd the "registr*tion of Mudbloods" with the Ministry) *s *n *llegory of criticising the st*te.[32]

Christi*n *llegories
See *lso: Religious deb*tes over the ***** Potter series § Christi*n *llegories in De*thly *******
The ***** Potter series h*s been criticised for supposedly supporting witchcr*ft *nd the occult. Before public*tion of De*thly *******, Rowling refused to spe*k out *bout her religion, st*ting, "If I t*lk too freely, every re*der, whether 10 or 60, will be *ble to guess wh*t's coming in the books".[33] However, m*ny h*ve noted Christi*n *llegories *pp*rent in De*thly *******.[33] For ex*mple, ***** dies *nd then comes b*ck to life to s*ve m*nkind, like Christ. The loc*tion where this occurs is King's Cross.[34] ***** *lso urges Voldemort to show remorse, to restore his sh*ttered soul. Rowling *lso st*ted th*t "my belief *nd my struggling with religious belief ... I think is quite *pp*rent in this book", which is shown *s ***** struggles with his f*ith in Dumbledore.[35]


The Philosopher's Stone *s pictured in Mich*el M*ier's 1617 *lchemic*l work At*l*nt* Fugiens, simil*r to the present*tion of the De*thly ******* *nd Resurrection Stone.
De*thly ******* begins with * p*ir of epigr*phs, one by Qu*ker le*der Willi*m Penn *nd one from Aeschylus' The Lib*tion Be*rers. Of this, Rowling s*id "I re*lly enjoyed choosing those two quot*tions bec*use one is p*g*n, of course, *nd one is from * Christi*n tr*dition. I'd known it w*s going to be those two p*ss*ges since Ch*mber w*s published. I *lw*ys knew [th*t] if I could use them *t the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relev*nt, then I went where I needed to go. They just s*y it *ll to me, they re*lly do".[36]

When ***** visits his p*rents' gr*ve, the biblic*l reference "The l*st enemy th*t sh*ll be destroyed is de*th" (1 Corinthi*ns 15:26) is inscribed on the gr*ve.[37] The Dumbledores' f*mily tomb *lso holds * biblic*l quote: "Where your tre*sure is, there your he*rt will be *lso", which is from M*tthew 6:21.[37] Rowling st*tes, "They're very British books, so on * very pr*ctic*l note ***** w*s going to find biblic*l quot*tions on tombstones ... [but] I think those two p*rticul*r quot*tions he finds on the tombstones *t Godric's Hollow, they sum up – they *lmost epitomise the whole series".[37]

***** Potter pundit John Gr*nger ***ition*lly noted th*t one of the re*sons the ***** Potter books were so popul*r is their use of liter*ry *lchemy (simil*r to Romeo *nd Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perel*ndr* *nd Ch*rles Dickens's A T*le of Two Cities) *nd vision symbolism.[38] In this model, *uthors we*ve *llegoric*l t*les *long the *lchemic*l m*gnum opus. Since the mediev*l period, *lchemic*l *llegory h*s mirrored the p*ssion, de*th *nd resurrection of Christ.[39] While the entire series utilizes symbols common in *lchemy, the De*thly ******* completes this cycle, tying themes of de*th, rebirth, *nd the Resurrection Stone to the princip*l motif of *lchemic*l *llegory, *nd topics presented in the first book of the series.

Bloomsbury invested £10 million in *n *ttempt to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the rele*se d*te.[47] Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the ***** Potter series, denied distributing *ny copies of De*thly ******* in *dv*nce for press review, but two U.S. p*pers published e*rly reviews *nyw*y.[48] There w*s specul*tion th*t some shops would bre*k the emb*rgo *nd distribute copies of the book e*rly, *s the pen*lty imposed for previous inst*lments—th*t the distributor would not be supplied with *ny further copies of the series—would no longer be * deterrent.[49]

On 16 July, * set of photogr*phs representing *ll 759 p*ges of the U.S. edition w*s le*ked *nd w*s fully tr*nscribed prior to the offici*l rele*se d*te.[50][51][52][53] The photogr*phs l*ter *ppe*red on websites *nd peer-to-peer networks, le*ding Schol*stic to seek * subpoen* in order to identify one source.[54] This represented the most serious security bre*ch in the ***** Potter series' history.[55] Rowling *nd her l*wyer confirmed th*t there were genuine online le*ks.[24][56] Reviews published in both The B*ltimore Sun *nd The New York Times on 18 July 2007, corrobor*ted m*ny of the plot elements from this le*k, *nd *bout one d*y prior to rele*se, The New York Times confirmed th*t the m*in circul*ting le*k w*s re*l.[55]

Schol*stic *nnounced th*t *pproxim*tely one-ten-thous*ndth (0.0001) of the U.S. supply h*d been shipped e*rly — interpreted to me*n *bout 1,200 copies. One re*der in M*ryl*nd received * copy of the book in the m*il from DeepDiscount.com four d*ys before it w*s l*unched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Schol*stic *nd DeepDiscount. Schol*stic initi*lly reported th*t they were s*tisfied it h*d been * "hum*n error" *nd would not discuss possible pen*lties;[57] however, the following d*y Schol*stic *nnounced th*t it would be l*unching leg*l *ction *g*inst DeepDiscount.com *nd its distributor, Levy Home Entert*inment.[58] Schol*stic filed for d*m*ges in Chic*go's Circuit Court of Cook County, cl*iming th*t DeepDiscount eng*ged in * "complete *nd fl*gr*nt viol*tion of the *greements th*t they knew were p*rt of the c*refully constructed rele*se of this e*gerly *w*ited book."[59] Some of the e*rly rele*se books soon *ppe*red on eB*y, in one c*se being sold to Publishers Weekly for US$250 from *n initi*l price of US$18.[60]

Price w*rs *nd other controversies
Asd*,[61][62] *long with sever*l other UK superm*rkets, h*ving *lre*dy t*ken pre-orders for the book *t * he*vily discounted price, sp*rked * price w*r two d*ys before the book's l*unch by *nnouncing they would sell it for just £5 * copy. Other ret*il ch*ins then *lso offered the book *t discounted prices. At these prices the book bec*me * loss le*der. This c*used upro*r from tr*dition*l UK booksellers who *rgued they h*d no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even W*terstone's, the UK's l*rgest dedic*ted ch*in bookstore, could not compete with the superm*rket price. Some sm*ll bookstores hit b*ck by buying their stock from the superm*rkets r*ther th*n their wholes*lers. Asd* *ttempted to counter this by imposing * limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purch*ses. Philip Wicks, * spokesm*n for the UK Booksellers Associ*tion, s*id, "It is * w*r we c*n't even p*rticip*te in. We think it's * crying sh*me th*t the superm*rkets h*ve decided to tre*t it *s * loss-le*der, like * c*n of b*ked be*ns." Mich*el Norris, *n *n*lyst *t Simb* Inform*tion, s*id: "You *re not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you *re lowering the v*lue of re*ding."[63]

In M*l*ysi*, * simil*r price w*r c*used controversy reg*rding s*les of the book.[64] Four of the biggest bookstore ch*ins in M*l*ysi*, MPH Bookstores, Popul*r Bookstores, Times *nd H*rris, decided to pull ***** Potter *nd the De*thly ******* off their shelves *s * protest *g*inst Tesco *nd C*rrefour hyperm*rkets. The ret*il price of the book in M*l*ysi* is MYR 109.90, while the hyperm*rkets Tesco *nd C*rrefour sold the book *t MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores w*s seen *s *n *ttempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hyperm*rkets. However, *s of 24 July 2007, the price w*r h*s ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books h*s *lso confirmed th*t Tesco *nd C*rrefour *re selling the book *t * loss, urging them to pr*ctice good business sense *nd f*ir tr*de.[65]

The book's e*rly S*turd*y morning rele*se in Isr*el w*s criticised for viol*ting Sh*bb*t. Tr*de *nd Industry Minister Eli Yish*i commented "It is forbidden, *ccording to Jewish v*lues *nd Jewish culture, th*t * thing like this should t*ke pl*ce *t 2 *m on S*turd*y. Let them do it on *nother d*y."[66] Yish*i indic*ted th*t he would issue indictments *nd fines b*sed on the Hours of Work *nd Rest L*w.[67]

Public*tion *nd reception
Critic*l response
The B*ltimore Sun‍‍ '​‍s critic, M*ry C*role McC*uley, noted th*t the book w*s more serious th*n the previous novels in the series *nd h*d more str*ightforw*rd prose.[68] Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordh*m from The Times wrote th*t "Rowling's genius is not just her tot*l re*lis*tion of * f*nt*sy world, but the quieter skill of cre*ting ch*r*cters th*t bounce off the p*ge, re*l *nd fl*wed *nd br*ve *nd lov*ble". Fordh*m concluded, "We h*ve been * long w*y together, *nd neither Rowling nor ***** let us down in the end".[69] The New York Times writer Michiko K*kut*ni *greed, pr*ising Rowling's *bility to m*ke ***** both * hero *nd * ch*r*cter th*t c*n be rel*ted to.[70]

Time m*g*zine's Lev Grossm*n n*med it one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, r*nking it *t No. 8, *nd pr*ised Rowling for proving th*t books c*n still be * glob*l m*ss medium.[28] Novelist Eliz*beth H*nd criticised th*t "... the spect*cul*rly complex interpl*y of n*rr*tive *nd ch*r*cter often re*ds *s though *n entire trilogy's worth of summing-up h*s been cr*mmed into one volume."[71] In * st*rred review from Kirkus Reviews, the reviewer s*id, "Rowling h*s shown uncommon skill in pl*ying them with *nd *g*inst e*ch other, *nd *lso woven them into * d*rn good bildungsrom*n, popul*ted by memor*ble ch*r*cters *nd infused with * s*ving, irrepressible sense of fun". They *lso pr*ised the second h*lf of the novel, but criticised the epilogue, c*lling it "provoc*tively sketchy".[72] In *nother review from The Times, reviewer Am*nd* Cr*ig s*id th*t while Rowling w*s "not *n origin*l, high-concept *uthor", she w*s "right up there with other gre*ts of children's fiction". Cr*ig went on to s*y th*t the novel w*s "be*utifully judged, *nd * triumph*nt return to form", *nd th*t Rowling's im*gin*tion ch*nged the perception of *n entire gener*tion, which "is more th*n *ll but * h*ndful of living *uthors, in *ny genre, h*ve *chieved in the p*st h*lf-century".[73]

In contr*st, Jenny S*wyer of The Christi*n Science Monitor s*id th*t, "There is much to love *bout the ***** Potter series, from its brilli*ntly re*lised m*gic*l world to its multil*yered n*rr*tive", however, "A story is *bout someone who ch*nges. And, puberty *side, ***** doesn't ch*nge much. As envisioned by Rowling, he w*lks the p*th of good so unw*veringly th*t his fin*l victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevit*ble, but hollow".[74] In The New York Times, Christopher Hitchens comp*red the series to World W*r Two-er* English bo*rding school stories, *nd while he wrote th*t "Rowling h*s won imperish*ble renown" for the series *s * whole, he *lso st*ted th*t he disliked Rowling's use of deus ex m*chin*, th*t the mid-book c*mping ch*pters *re "*bysm*lly long", *nd Voldemort "becomes more tiresome th*n *n I*n Fleming vill*in".[75] C*therine Bennett of The Gu*rdi*n pr*ised Rowling for putting sm*ll det*ils from the previous books *nd m*king them l*rge in De*thly *******, such *s Grindelw*ld being mentioned on * Chocol*te Frog C*rd in the first book. While she points out "*s her critics s*y, Rowling is no Dickens", she s*ys th*t Rowling "h*s willed into * fiction*l being, in every book, legions of new ch*r*cters, pl*ces, spells, rules *nd scores of unim*gined twists *nd subplots".[76]

Stephen King criticised the re*ctions of some reviewers to the books, including McC*uley, for jumping too quickly to surf*ce conclusions of the work.[77] He felt this w*s inevit*ble, bec*use of the extreme secrecy before l*unch which did not *llow reviewers time to re*d *nd consider the book, but me*nt th*t m*ny e*rly reviews l*cked depth. R*ther th*n finding the writing style dis*ppointing, he felt it h*d m*tured *nd improved. He *cknowledged th*t the subject m*tter of the books h*d become more *dult, *nd th*t Rowling h*d cle*rly been writing with the *dult *udience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He comp*red the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn *nd Alice in Wonderl*nd which *chieved success *nd h*ve become est*blished cl*ssics, in p*rt by *ppe*ling to the *dult *udience *s well *s children.[77]
